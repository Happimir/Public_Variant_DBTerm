*How to Run The Bot*
	**In order to successfully run the bot, you first need to start it by typing node bot.js in its directory. Then when you go online
	you have to type localhost:90900/name=$&count=$ where the $ (dollar signs) is a placeholder for the screen_name of the user you are interested 
	in; say like bbc or cnn, and the count is how many tweets do we want to get back. According to Twitter's API their maxiumum is about 200.**
